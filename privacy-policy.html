          <div class="policyCard">
            <p>
              At SIA Software Innovations, we value privacy because trust and
              clarity are the foundation of any lasting relationship. This policy
              explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we
              use it to deliver the Services. We wrote it in plain language so it
              is easy to understand. If anything feels unclear, we encourage you
              to contact us and we will gladly help.
            </p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>
              We collect information in three main ways: details you provide to
              us directly, information generated through your use of the Services,
              and limited information from third parties that you choose to
              connect. This allows us to create your account, keep the platform
              secure, and deliver the features you expect in a dependable way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Information you provide includes your name, email address, phone
              number, and account credentials when you register or log in. It can
              also include datasets you upload, descriptions you add, and any
              messages you send through contact or support forms. We only request
              what is needed to deliver the Services and respond properly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Information created through your use of the Services includes
              activity data such as pages you view, features you interact with,
              dataset views or downloads, device type, browser type, language
              settings, and approximate location derived from your IP address.
              This usage data helps us improve performance, reliability, and
              overall product quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Information from third parties may include authentication details
              from single sign-on providers such as Google when you choose to use
              those services. We only receive the data you authorize the provider
              to share, and we do not access any additional data without your
              permission.
            </p>

            <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>
              We use information to provide, secure, and improve the Services.
              This includes creating accounts, authenticating access, enabling
              dataset uploads, and showing datasets based on your permissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also use information to maintain performance, diagnose issues,
              prevent abuse, and protect our users. Usage insights help us
              understand what is working well and where we can make the
              experience smoother and more reliable.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you contact support, we use your information to respond to your
              request, verify account ownership, and keep a record of our
              communications so we can provide consistent and helpful support.
            </p>

            <h2>Communications</h2>
            <p>
              We may send service-related communications such as security alerts,
              billing notices, or updates about changes to the Services. These
              messages are important for account safety and cannot always be
              opted out of.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we send marketing or product updates, you can opt out at any
              time by using the unsubscribe link or contacting us directly. We
              respect your preferences and aim to keep communications relevant.
            </p>

            <h2>Legal Bases (Where Applicable)</h2>
            <p>
              When required by law, we process personal data based on one or more
              legal bases such as performing a contract (providing the Services),
              legitimate interests (improving security and product quality), or
              consent (for optional features or marketing communications).
            </p>

            <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
            <p>
              We do not sell personal information. We share information only as
              needed to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, or
              protect users and the platform. We take a minimal approach so your
              data is exposed only when necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may share data with trusted service providers that perform
              functions on our behalf, such as hosting, analytics, or customer
              support. These providers are contractually required to protect your
              information and use it only for the services they provide to us.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may disclose information if required by law, such as to comply
              with a court order or lawful request by authorities, or to protect
              the rights, safety, and security of our users and our platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets,
              your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
              We will notify you if your information becomes subject to a
              different privacy policy.
            </p>

            <h2>Public and Private Datasets</h2>
            <p>
              Public datasets you choose to publish are visible to all visitors,
              including people who are not logged in. Private datasets are
              visible only to you and authorized accounts as configured in the
              Services. Please review dataset visibility settings carefully
              before publishing.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
              We retain personal information only as long as needed to provide
              the Services, meet legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce
              our agreements. You can request deletion of your account and
              associated data, subject to legal and operational requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Backups and logs are maintained for a limited period for security
              and reliability. When data is removed, we take reasonable steps to
              delete it from active systems and to phase it out of backups within
              their normal lifecycle.
            </p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
              We take security seriously and use reasonable safeguards to protect
              your data. This includes access controls, encryption in transit,
              and ongoing monitoring. No system is perfectly secure, and we
              cannot guarantee absolute security, but we work hard to keep your
              information safe.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
            <p>
              You can update or correct your account information from your
              profile or by contacting support. You can also delete your account
              by submitting a request. If you are located in certain
              jurisdictions, you may have additional rights such as data access,
              portability, or objection to certain processing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We respond to verified requests as required by law. For your
              protection, we may need to confirm your identity before fulfilling
              certain requests.
            </p>

            <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
            <p>
              We use cookies and similar technologies to keep you signed in,
              remember preferences, and understand usage patterns. You can
              control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling cookies
              may limit some features.
            </p>

            <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
            <p>
              Our Services may include links to third-party websites or services.
              We do not control those sites and are not responsible for their
              privacy practices. Please review their policies before providing
              any information.
            </p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              The Services are not directed to children under 16. We do not
              knowingly collect personal information from children. If you
              believe a child has provided us with personal information, please
              contact us and we will take appropriate action.
            </p>

            <h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
              We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the
              Services, legal requirements, or industry practices. When we do,
              we will post an updated version and, when appropriate, notify you
              of significant changes.
            </p>

            <h2>Contact Us</h2>

            <p>
              Welcome to SIA Software Innovations. These Terms of Service
              ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our website, products,
              and services (the "Services"). By creating an account, accessing
              any page, or using the Services in any way, you agree to be bound
              by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Services.
            </p>

            <h2>Who May Use the Services</h2>
            <p>
              You must be at least 16 years old, or the age of majority in your
              jurisdiction, to use the Services. If you are using the Services on
              behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the
              authority to bind that organization to these Terms.
            </p>

            <h2>Accounts and Access</h2>
            <p>
              You are responsible for the accuracy of the information you provide
              when creating an account and for maintaining the confidentiality of
              your login credentials. You are also responsible for all activity
              that occurs under your account, whether or not you authorized it.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you believe your account has been compromised, notify us
              promptly. We may suspend or disable accounts that appear to be
              compromised or that violate these Terms to protect the platform and
              our users.
            </p>

            <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>
              You agree not to misuse the Services. This includes attempting to
              gain unauthorized access, distributing malware, interfering with
              system integrity, scraping or harvesting data in a way that
              disrupts the Services, or uploading content that violates
              applicable law or third-party rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are responsible for ensuring that any dataset you upload is
              lawful and that you have the right to share it. You may not upload
              sensitive personal data, such as government IDs, financial account
              numbers, or medical records, unless you have a valid legal basis
              and explicit permission to share such data.
            </p>

            <h2>Datasets and Content</h2>
            <p>
              You retain ownership of your content. By uploading datasets to the
              Services, you grant us a limited license to host, store, and
              process that content for the purpose of providing the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you mark a dataset as public, you acknowledge that it may be
              viewed and downloaded by anyone. If you mark a dataset as private,
              we will restrict access to your account or other authorized users
              as configured in the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you submit feedback, ideas, or suggestions, you agree that we
              may use them without restriction or obligation to you. This helps
              us improve the platform in ways that benefit all users.
            </p>

            <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
              The Services, including software, design, branding, and content
              provided by us, are protected by intellectual property laws. You
              may not copy, modify, reverse engineer, or distribute any part of
              the Services except as permitted by law or with our written
              permission.
            </p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
              The Services may include or integrate with third-party services,
              such as authentication providers or external links. Your use of
              those services is governed by their terms, and we are not
              responsible for their content or practices.
            </p>

            <h2>Service Availability and Changes</h2>
            <p>
              We work hard to keep the Services available and reliable, but we do
              not guarantee uninterrupted access. We may modify, suspend, or
              discontinue any part of the Services at any time, with or without
              notice, to improve quality, ensure security, or comply with legal
              requirements.
            </p>

            <h2>Fees and Payments</h2>
            <p>
              If we offer paid plans or features in the future, we will clearly
              describe the pricing and billing terms. Any fees will be billed in
              advance unless otherwise stated, and you are responsible for any
              applicable taxes.
            </p>

            <h2>Termination</h2>
            <p>
              You may stop using the Services at any time and request deletion of
              your account. We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate
              these Terms, create risk for other users, or misuse the Services.
            </p>

            <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>
              The Services are provided "as is" and "as available." We disclaim
              warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including
              implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
              purpose, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the
              Services will be error-free or secure.
            </p>

            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
              To the maximum extent permitted by law, SIA Software Innovations
              will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
              consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits,
              revenues, data, or goodwill arising from or related to your use of
              the Services.
            </p>

            <h2>Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
              You agree to indemnify and hold harmless SIA Software Innovations
              from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising from
              your use of the Services, your content, or your violation of these
              Terms or applicable law.
            </p>

            <h2>Export and Compliance</h2>
            <p>
              You agree to comply with all applicable export and sanctions laws.
              You may not use the Services if you are prohibited from receiving
              services under applicable laws.
            </p>

            <h2>Governing Law</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms are governed by the laws of your primary business
              location, unless otherwise required by law. Any disputes will be
              resolved in the courts of the relevant jurisdiction, unless an
              alternative dispute resolution process is required by law.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>
              We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material
              changes, we will provide reasonable notice by posting an update on
              the site or through other communications. Your continued use of the
              Services after updates are posted constitutes acceptance of the
              revised Terms.
            </p>
